Sinatra is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) for quickly creating web-applications in Ruby.

It keeps a minimal feature set, leaving the developer to use the tools that best suit them and their application.

It doesnâ€™t assume much about your application, apart from that:

it will be written in Ruby programming language
it will have URLs
In Sinatra, you can write short ad hoc applications or mature, larger application with the same easiness.
